<h2>Mediotype's Google Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics Magento Integration</h2>

<u><strong>Why Is Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics Important?</strong></u>

<p>Without the thorough and continuous study of your websites analytics, you would not be able to design a proper
    strategy for optimal marketing improvements. Without collecting the accurate data of your websites performance, you
    would not have the analytics to study. Google Analytics itself is obviously worth using. The data gathered and
    presented is a
    vital learning tool for any manager of online ecommerce. Using Google's Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics with Magento
    provides even more insights and benefits for digital merchants.</p>

<p>The Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics was a revamp of Google's prior ecommerce analytics which was designed to offer
    better insights and information into pre-purchasing shopping behavior as well as provide product performance data,
    actionable by a merchants marketing & technology teams. It's intention was to keep pace with the ever growing size
    and complexity of online retail. Data can come in many forms, all of which is useful, collecting that data and
    providing powerful reports is the main intent behind Google's ever advancing analytics suite.</p>

<p>>Offering deeper insights into the behavior of customers, Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics allows Magento retailers to
    make wiser decisions, and learn more about both their site and customer. The need for more specific and higher
    quality data sets is constantly changing and this required a more sophisticated and comprehensive analysis tool in
    order to understand shopper behavior and product performance. The market demand was there, and actually grew into a
    need; Google created the Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics feature and built it atop the Universal Analytics & ec.js
    foundation. This includes tracking code updates, data model changes, and new end-user reports targeted to optimize
    ecommerce intelligence. Together these allow for managers to better understand how customers engage with a website
    throughout the checkout process, and how products perform overall throughout the same process. Watch as data shows
    the effectiveness of on-site merchandising, which customers purchased based on an up-sell offer, and where in the
    sales funnel customers got lost.</p>

<p>Enhanced Ecommerce helps to over come many challenges that once plagued owners, mangers and marketers alike. With it
    you can gain deep insight into the absolute most important
    <a href="http://www.mediotype.com/blog/digital-marketing/brief-introduction-into-ecommerce-kpi" target="_blank">eCommerce
        KPI's;</a> about shopper behavior, conversions, product views, product view placements, cart additions, cart
    abandonments, product abandonments, customer navigation, and even payment methods.</p>

<p>In sum, Google breaks the benefits of their Enhanced Ecommerce down into Two main sections: Insights and
    Optimization. Which are really the only benefits regular Google Analytics is good for as well. This powerful
    mechanism enables Magento merchants to optimize their customer engagement and increase results.</p>

        catalog and search results pages, related products merchandising blocks, as well as cross-sell and up-sell
        blocks.
        Product List Performance reports then allow you to see which lists appeared to which users, which products
        appeared
        in those lists, and the clicks, views, and click through rate for each list, list position, and product. Product
        placement, exposure, and order value matter, knowing what you want to show to who and where makes all the
        difference.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality of Mediotype's Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics Extension for Magento</h2>

<p>So then, how does the Google Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics Extension for Magento work? Following Magento best
    practices, this light weight module takes responsibility for using layout xml to remove Magentoâ€™s built in Google
    Analytics ga.js tracking code. The extension inserts properly formatted analytics.js with an include for the 'ec'
    functionality that Google requires for Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics just before the opening body tag. Ecommerce
    analytics calls have some key considerations, for example once a page view is sent, ecommerce data can not be sent,
    so we've left the page view send to be responsible for the push to analytics and hooked it just before the closing
    body tag.</p>
