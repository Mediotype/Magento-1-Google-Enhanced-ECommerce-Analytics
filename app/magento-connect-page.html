<h1>Mediotype's Google Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics for Magento</h1>

<p>Without continual investigation of your sites analytics, you would not have the ability to form a
    proper marketing. Without gathering the accurate information of your sites performance, you would
    not have data to study. Google Analytics itself is clearly worth utilizing. The information their system provides is
    a fundamental learning instrument for any administrator of a site. Utilizing Google's Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics
    further gives greater insights and information specific to online retailers and ecommerce businesses. This is why
    Mediotype created the Google Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics Extension for Magneto websites. Making utilizing this
    available analytical information seamless and simple.</p>

<h2>Functionality of Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics with Magento</h2>

<p>How does the Google Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics Extension for Magento work? Following Magento best practices, this
    light weight module takes responsibility for using layout xml to remove Magentoâ€™s built in Google Analytics ga.js
    tracking code. The extension inserts properly formatted analytics.js with an include for the 'ec' functionality that
    google requires for Enhanced Ecommerce Analytics just before the opening body tag. Ecommerce analytics calls have
    some key considerations, for example once a page view is sent, ecommerce data can not be sent, so we've left the
    page view send to be responsible for the push to analytics and hooked it just before the closing body tag.</p>

    Analytics reporting for Magento platform users. Every manager realizes the importance of collecting timely, useful,
